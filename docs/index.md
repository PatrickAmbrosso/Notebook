  <h2>What is Patfolio?</h2>
  <p>"<strong>Patfolio</strong>" – a clever fusion of my name, <em>Patrick</em>, with the essence of a <em>portfolio</em>. It's more than just a name though, as this website is my way of showcasing who I am – the skills that I practice, the knowledge I have accumulated, and the experiences I have had – for anyone and everyone interested in learning a thing or two.</p>
  <p>
    Here, you can expect a curated collection of my professional journey. From my hands-on experiences as an Operations Engineer with a DevOps mindset working in a pharmaceutical company to my tinkering escapades in the HomeLab and ventures in design, this platform offers a glimpse into my diverse world. Explore insightful articles, practical tech insights, and perhaps a sprinkle of design inspiration. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a design aficionado, or simply someone curious about my endeavors, I hope to provide a little something for everyone here. So, join me on my voyage as we navigate through the realms of technology, design, and beyond.
