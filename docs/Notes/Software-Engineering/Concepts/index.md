## Authentication
Authentication is a way to verify if the user is who they say they are. User names and passwords are the most common types of authentication mechanisms. Authentication can also be made via token-based systems and biometric data such as fingerprint.
Authentication simply answers the question, **"are you who you say you are?"**

## Authorization
Authorization is the process of giving users access to resources and/or services. Authorization determines whether a user can perform actions such as create, edit and delete.
Authorization simply answers the question, **"what actions can you perform?"**

## Programming Case Types
Source Article: [Most Common Programming Case Types](https://chaseadams.io/posts/most-common-programming-case-types/) 

### camelCase
`camelCase` must start with a lowercase letter and the first letter of every new subsequent word has its first letter capitalized and is compounded with the previous word.
An example of camel case of the variable `camel case var` is `camelCaseVar`.

### snake_case
`snake_case` is as simple as replacing all spaces with a "\_" and lowercasing all the words. 
An example of snake case of the variable `snake case var` is `snake_case_var`.

### kebab-case
`kebab-case` is as simple as replacing all spaces with a "-" and lowercasing all the words. 
An example of kebab case of the variable `kebab case var` is `kebab-case-var`.

### PascalCase
`PascalCase` has every word starts with an uppercase letter (unlike camelCase in that the first word starts with a lowercase letter).
An example of pascal case of the variable `pascal case var` is `PascalCaseVar`.

### UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE
`UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` is replacing all the spaces with a "\_" and converting all the letters to capitals.
An example of upper case snake case of the variable `upper case snake case var` is `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE_VAR`.
