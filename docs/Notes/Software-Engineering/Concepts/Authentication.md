## What is Authentication?
Authentication is a way to verify if the user is who they say they are. User names and passwords are the most common types of authentication mechanisms. Authentication can also be made via token-based systems and biometric data such as fingerprint.

Authentication simply answers the question, **"are you who you say you are?"**
