### Ways to run Python
Python can be run in 3 different ways and their features and who might consider using them are tabulated below. 

| Environment                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Examples           | Use Cases                                                                                                            |

| Text Editors                             | Platforms to write any form of textual data (of many file types) that can be customized with plugins to add functionality.                                                                                       | Sublime Text, Atom | Useful for lightweight python programming or scripting without the need to install any heavy software.               |
| Integrated Development Environment (IDE) | Development environment designed specifically to run python code. These are mostly larger programs with additional functionality geared towards python development. They are often offered as a Freemium option. | PyCharm, Spyder    | Useful for hardcore python development and when additional features are required to ease the process of development. |
| Notebook Environment                     | Platforms that are well suited for learning python that support in-line markdown notes. These are not regular `.py` files. But they support input and output one after the other.                                | Jupyter Notebook   | Useful in visualizing and learning python in the same environment. It supports sharing of these notebooks with ease.                                                                                                                     |
