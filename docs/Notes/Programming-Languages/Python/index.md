# Python
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and clean syntax. **Guido van Rossum** created Python and released its first version in 1991. Python's development began in the late 1980s when Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, started working on it during his Christmas holidays in December 1989. He aimed to create a language that emphasized code readability and ease of use, allowing developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java. The first official version, *Python 0.9.0*, was released in *February 1991*. Python's design philosophy, often summarized as "The Zen of Python," emphasizes *simplicity*, *readability*, and a focus on *practicality*. *Python 2.0*, released in *2000*, introduced list comprehensions and garbage collection. *Python 3.0*, released in *2008*, marked a significant shift with various changes to improve consistency and eliminate redundancies in the language.

Some of the key features that python emphasizes are as follows
- **Readability** - Python's syntax is designed to be easily readable and intuitive, which reduces the cost of program maintenance and enhances collaboration.
- **High-level Language** - Python abstracts complex low-level details, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers.
- **Dynamic Typing** - Variables are dynamically typed, allowing them to change type during runtime.
- **Extensive Standard Library** - Python includes a wide range of modules and libraries for various tasks, from web development to data analysis.
- **Interpreted** - Python is interpreted, which means code can be executed directly without the need for compilation.
- **Cross-Platform** - Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Today, Python has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages due to its versatility, ease of learning, and widespread use across diverse domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

## Core Concepts
- [Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md) - Installing Python and running the mandatory 'Hello World' code
- [Fundamentals](./Fundamentals.md) - Installing Python and running the mandatory 'Hello World' code
- [Data Types and Variables](./Data-Types-and-Variables.md) - Installing Python and running the mandatory 'Hello World' code
- [Operators](./Operators.md) - Installing Python and running the mandatory 'Hello World' code
- [Flow Control and Loops](./Flow-Control-and-Loops.md) - Installing Python and running the mandatory 'Hello World' code
- [Methods and Functions](./Methods-and-Functions.md) - Working with custom/user-defined blocks of code. Functions allow making the code easier to read, less verbose and concise
