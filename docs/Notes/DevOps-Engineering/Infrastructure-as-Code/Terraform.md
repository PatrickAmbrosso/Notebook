# Terraform
Terraform by is an [Infrastructure as Code](Infrastructure%20as%20Code.md#) tool offering by [HashiCorp](Hashicorp.md#) for building, changing and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It enables application software best practices to infrastructure. It is *provider agnostic* and is compatible with a multitude of cloud providers and services. Terraform uses declarative configuration files written in *HashiCorp Configuration Language* or *HCL* which is a cross between YAML and JSON, with additional features.

::: details Just get me started, please...
**Terraform Basic Concepts**
1. **Declarative Configuration:** The desired state of the infrastructure is defined in a configuration file using a configuration language called *HCL*, thereby specifying the resources and their properties.
2. **Providers:** Terraform supports various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and other infrastructure technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) through provider plugins. To use a particular provider, they have to imported.
3. **Resources:** Resources are the infrastructure components defined in the configuration, such as virtual machines, databases, networks, and more.
4. **State:** Terraform is idempotent, and keeps track of the actual state of your infrastructure in a state file. This allows it to plan and execute changes while maintaining resource consistency and idempotency.

**Basic Workflow**
1. **Configuration:** The configuration (using the HCL syntax) is written to files with a `.tf`  extension. This file specifies the requirements for the resources, their attributes, and dependencies (if any).
2. **Initialization:** Start a terraform project by running `terraform init`. This downloads the necessary provider plugins and initializes the Terraform workspace.
3. **Planning:** Running `terraform plan` allows terraform to plan the steps it needs to make to set up the infrastructure as mentioned in the configuration file, helping to understand the changes before they are applied.
4. **Execution:** Running `terraform apply` spins up terraform to create/modify the infrastructure resources as defined in the configuration. Terraform will make the necessary API calls to the chosen provider(s) as configured and initialized. Note that this command can be run multiple times, and will still yield the same result (idempotency). If any changes are made to the configuration files, terraform updates the infrastructure to match the changes.
5. **Cleanup:** When a resource or if the entire infrastructure project is no longer required, the `terraform destroy` command can be used to remove them from existence. Care must be taken, as this deletes the virtual infrastructure.

### Advantages
1. **IaC for Exotic Providers**
	- Terraform supports major providers including [AWS](Amazon%20Web%20Services.md#), [Azure](Microsoft%20Azure.md#) and [GCP](Google%20Cloud%20Platform.md#).
	- Other than the most common ones, it supports a wide collection of other providers as well.
	- Any cloud-based application that can expose an API can be controlled and managed by terraform.
2. **Multi-tier Applications**
	- Terraform allows to divide large complex models smaller manageable chunks/applications called as modules.
	- This helps to reduce the complexity of the configuration being used to manage the resources, while retaining some of the features of imperative IaC tools. 
3. **Disposable Environment**
	- Quickly create, replicate and destroy infrastructure in the cloud across environments.
4. **Resource Schedulers**
	- Terraform can be used to dynamically schedule and use resources
5. **Multi-cloud Deployment**
	- Terraform is cloud agnostic and it can provision and maintain resources across a multitude of providers.
	- One configuration can be used to maintain various cloud providers.

## Core Concepts

### Terraform Architecture

![Terraform Core-Plugin Workflow](https://developer.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.hashicorp.com%2Fapi%2Fassets%3Fproduct%3Dterraform-docs-common%26version%3Drefs%252Fheads%252Fmain%26asset%3Dwebsite%252Fimg%252Fdocs%252Fterraform-plugin-overview.png%26width%3D4096%26height%3D728&w=3840&q=75)

Terraform is logically split into two main parts.
1. **Terraform Core**
	- It is a statically-compiled binary written in the [Go Programming Language](GoLang.md#).
	- The compiled binary is called the *Terraform CLI*.
	- The code is open-source and is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform)
	- The primary responsibilities of Terraform Core are as follows
		-   Infrastructure as code: reading and interpolating configuration files and modules
		-   Resource state management
		-   Construction of theÂ [Resource Graph](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/graph)
		-   Plan execution
		-   Communication with plugins over RPC
2. **Terraform Plugins**
	- The terraform plugins are also written in the [Go Programming Language](GoLang.md#).
	- These are executable binaries that are invoked by the Terraform Core.
	- There are two types of plugins, namely
		- *Provider Plugins*
		- *Provisioner Plugins*
	- The primary responsibilities of Provider Plugins are as follows
		-   Initialization of any included libraries used to make API calls
		-   Authentication with the Infrastructure Provider
		-   Define Resources that map to specific Services
	- The primary responsibilities of Provisioner Plugins are as follows
		-   Executing commands or scripts on the designated Resource after creation, or on destruction.

### Terraform Files and Directories
1. **Terraform Variables File (`.tfvars`)**
2. **Terraform Configuration Files (`.tf` )**
	- Files ending with a `.tf` are terraform configuration files.
	- Terraform combines all the files with a `.tf` ending and considers as a single configuration file.
	- This aids in segmenting code for organization.
	- These files are written in *HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)* (resembles JSON).
	- These configuration files explain terraform the desired state of the resources that need to be managed by terraform.
	- This forms the basis of the imperative approach to IaC.
3. **Terraform State File (`terraform.tfstate`)**
	* It describes the actual state of the resources managed by terraform.
	- This environment could correspond to resources, data
	- `.tfstate` files are written in JSON.
	- `.tfstate` files can be stored locally or remotely.
	- The state files tend to contain passwords and other credentials, so it is the responsibility of the user to encrypt and handle the state files.
4. **Terraform Dependency Lock File (`.terraform.lock.hcl`)**
	- Dependency locks are used only in Terraform version 0.14 or higher.
	- `.terraform.lock.hcl` file is used to lock and track the dependencies across providers and modules in use in the current terraform configuration files.
	- The syntax is NOT terraform code, but follows the same low-level syntax of HCL, thus it has the extension `.hcl`. 
	- It gets created when the `terraform init` command is run.
	- It is located in the root directory of where the configuration files exist.
	- It is recommended to include the dependency lock file in the version controlled repositories along with the terraform configuration files.
6. **Terraform Directory (`.terraform`)**


> [!caution] Handling Resources Manually
> - Avoid manually changing the resources in their respective GUIs outside of terraform.
> - This can cause huge problems in the state that is maintained by terraform.
> - Always manage the resources within terraform only.

> [!danger] Editing the `.tfstate` file
> - Do not manually edit the .tfstate file.
> - Terraform uses the .tfstate file to provision, manage and destroy resources.
> - Manual edits to this file might cause unforseen issues on the actual resources managed by terraform.

### Basic Lifecycle of a Terraform Deployment
A barebones lifecycle of operations that can be carried out in a terraform configuration would consist of the following steps.
1. **Code** - Preparing and setting up the configuration file
2. **initializing** - Initialize all the providers and dependencies of the configuration for terraform to manage the required resources.
3. **Validation** - Check if the configuration has any mistakes in syntax or logic.
4. **Plan** - Ideate the sequence of operations that is required to be performed to arrive at the said configuration.
5. **Apply** - Do all the steps to arrive at the said configuration.
6. **Destroy** - Destroy all the resources that are managed by the the configuration.

### Backend
- A backend defines where terraform stores its state data files. this is DynamoDB 


#### Managing Backend

#### Local Backend
- Store the state file locally
- Sensitive information is stored locally in plain text.
- Not collaborative
- Manual process

#### Remote Backend
- Files are stores on remote backend services such as [Amazon S3](Amazon%20Simple%20Storage%20Service.md#) or [HashiCorp Cloud](HashiCorp%20Cloud.md#).
- Data is encrypted.
- Collaboration as it is hosted on cloud.
- Possibility of automation.
- Problem is more complexity

##### HashiCorp/Terraform Cloud
- HashiCorp also has a cloud offering to manage the resources maintained by their products.
- Terraform cloud is a subset of cloud offerings by HashiCorp and can be found [here]([Terraform | HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)).

##### Amazon S3 
- For this configuration, an [Amazon S3](Amazon%20Simple%20Storage%20Service.md#) bucket as well as a [DynamoDB](Amazon%20DynamoDB.md#) table needs to be set up.
- Here, the S3 bucket offers storage and the DynamoDB table is used to state locking.
- In order to manage the S3 Bucket and the DynamoDB table with terraform itself while using these two as the remote backend, a little bit of pre-configuration needs to be done.
	- Initially, the S3 Bucket and DynamoDB table are created with local backend.
	- Initialize and apply the terraform configuration.
	- Then change the backend to use S3 and DynamoDB.
	- Run `terraform apply` to apply the modified terraform configuration.
	- Terraform will not migrate the backend to the S3 Bucket and DynamoDB combination.

## Terraform Commands
 
> [!important] General Terraform Syntax
> `terraform [global options] <subcommand> [args]` 

> [!info] Flags in commands
> Terraform is not very strict in the syntax for flags. Flags can be written with both one dash or two dashes.
> For instance, `terraform -version` and `terraform --version` are both valid.

1. `terraform -version` - Shows the current version of terraform that is installed.
2. 
3. `terraform init` - It initializes the terraform environment
	- The command downloads the essential code for the *providers* and *modules* if any specified in the `.tf` files.
	- The configurations downloaded get stored in the `.terraform` directory.
	- **Flags:** 
4. `terraform plan` - Plans the sequence of steps needed to provision the desired environment. Checks the resources that it needs to create, modify or destroy.
	- **Flags:**
5. `terraform apply` - Executes the configuration to create, modify or destroy resources.
	- **Flags:** 
		- `--auto-approve` - Does not wait for confirmation, executes it straight, provided no variables need to be supplied.
6. `terraform destroy` - Undo for all the configuration that is currently managed by the terraform configuration. Does not touch the resources that are not maintained by the configuration. 
	- **Flags:** 
		- `--auto-approve` - Does not wait for confirmation, executes it straight, provided no variables need to be supplied.
