# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Infrastructure as Code** (**IaC**) is a practice in software engineering that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure using *code and automation tools*. It allows defining and managing infrastructure, such as servers, networks, and databases, using code rather than manual processes.
This code is typically written using configuration files, and it can be versioned and stored in a version control system such as git. IaC brings *consistency*, *repeatability*, and *efficiency* to infrastructure management, making it easier to deploy and manage complex systems while reducing the chances of human errors.

The following table aims to perform a brief comparison between manual configuration to an IaC approach

| Aspect                  | Manual Configuration                      | Infrastructure as Code (IaC)                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**             | Prone to inconsistencies                  | Ensures uniform configurations              |
| **Automation**              | Manual tasks, time-consuming              | Automated provisioning and setup            |
| **Version Control**         | Changes not easily versioned              | Code stored in version control systems      |
| **Scalability**             | Difficulty scaling up                     | Supports consistent scaling                 |
| **Documentation**           | Separate documentation required           | Infrastructure code serves as documentation |
| **Reproducibility**         | Inconsistent environments                 | Reliable recreation of exact setups         |
| **Dependency**              | Relies on specific personnel              | Reduces dependency on individuals           |
| **Security**                | Vulnerabilities due to inconsistent setup | Enforces security best practices            |
| **Auditing**                | Difficult to track changes                | Changes tracked in version control          |
| **Updates and Maintenance** | Complex and time-consuming updates        | Streamlines updates and maintenance         |

## IaC and its role in Infrastructure Lifecycle
The concept of infrastructure lifecycle refers to the stages that an IT infrastructure goes through, from planning and design to implementation, operation, and eventual decommissioning. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) plays a crucial role in various phases of this lifecycle, as showcased below.

1. **Planning and Design**
    - IaC helps in defining and designing infrastructure configurations using code. This allows you the modeling of the desired architecture and configurations before actual implementation.
    - Infrastructure blueprints are created, detailing the resources, services, and networks required for the project.
2. **Implementation**
    - IaC tools are used to provision and configure the defined infrastructure based on the coded configurations.
    - Code templates are deployed to cloud platforms or on-premises environments to create the actual infrastructure.
3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
    - IaC enables consistent and repeatable testing by ensuring that the same infrastructure is deployed for each test cycle.
    - Automated testing can be performed on infrastructure code to identify configuration issues early in the development process.
4. **Deployment and Release**
    - IaC ensures that the same code is used for deploying infrastructure in different environments, leading to consistent deployments across development, testing, and production.
    - Release pipelines can be set up to automate the deployment of both application code and infrastructure code.
5. **Operations and Monitoring**
    - IaC facilitates efficient monitoring and management of infrastructure by providing a clear understanding of the configurations in use.
    - Changes to infrastructure can be tracked through version control, simplifying troubleshooting and auditing.
6. **Scaling and Maintenance**
    - IaC allows for easy scaling of infrastructure by adjusting the configuration code or parameters as needed.
    - Updates and maintenance can be performed by making changes to the code and then deploying the updated configuration.
7. **Decommissioning**
    - When infrastructure is no longer needed, IaC makes it straightforward to tear down resources by executing code that reverses the provisioning process.
    - This ensures that all resources are properly terminated and no lingering components are left behind.

Apart from this classification, SysAdmins also refer to the infrastructure lifecycle in a simple method as classified below. 

| Activities  | Day 0                                                     | Day 1                                           | Day 2                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**  | Initial *planning*, *design*, and *implementation* phase. | *Deployment* and *initial configuration* phase. | Ongoing *operations*, *management*, and *maintenance* phase. |
| **Roles of IaC** | IaC defines the infrastructure model.                     | IaC automates resource provisioning.            | IaC aids in monitoring configurations.                       |
|             | Templates/blueprints created.                             | Ensures consistent setup.                       | Automates routine maintenance tasks.                         |
|             | Provides a foundation for deployment.                     | Supports reliable deployments.                  | Enables controlled changes.                                  |

## IaC Approaches
Based on how an IaC tool approaches the definition and management of the resources, there are two ways it can be accomplished.

| Aspect             | Declarative Approach                                          | Imperative Approach                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**         | The end-state is expressed                                    | Step by step definition is provided                      |
| **Approach**           | The requirement is defined, the tool figures out the approach | Explicit step-wise instructions are provided to the tool |
| **Focus**              | End-state configuration                                       | Procedural configuration                                 |
| **Usage**              | Suitable for provisioning complex resources                   | Managing individual servers and nodes                    |
| **Abstraction Level**  | Higher level, abstract                                        | Lower level, detailed                                    |
| **Flexibility**        | Less specific instructions                                    | Highly specific instructions                             |
| **Human Intervention** | Less control over individual steps                            | More control over each step                              |
| **Examples**           | [Terraform](./Terraform.md#), [CloudFormation](AWS%20CloudFormation.md#), Azure RM templates                 | [Ansible](Ansible.md#), [Puppet](Puppet.md#), [Chef](Chef.md#)                                    |
