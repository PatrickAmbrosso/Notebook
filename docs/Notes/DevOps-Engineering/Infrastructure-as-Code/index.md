# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Infrastructure as Code** (**IaC**) is a practice in software engineering that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure using *code and automation tools*. It allows defining and managing infrastructure, such as servers, networks, and databases, using code rather than manual processes.
This code is typically written using configuration files, and it can be versioned and stored in a version control system such as git. IaC brings *consistency*, *repeatability*, and *efficiency* to infrastructure management, making it easier to deploy and manage complex systems while reducing the chances of human errors.

The following table aims to perform a brief comparison between manual configuration to an IaC approach

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**             | Prone to inconsistencies                  | Ensures uniform configurations              |
| **Automation**              | Manual tasks, time-consuming              | Automated provisioning and setup            |
| **Version Control**         | Changes not easily versioned              | Code stored in version control systems      |
| **Scalability**             | Difficulty scaling up                     | Supports consistent scaling                 |

## The Fundamentals of IaC

### IaC and Infrastructure Lifecycle
The concept of infrastructure lifecycle refers to the stages that an IT infrastructure goes through, from planning and design to implementation, operation, and eventual decommissioning. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) plays a crucial role in various phases of this lifecycle, as showcased below.

1. **Planning and Design**
    - IaC helps in defining and designing infrastructure configurations using code. This allows you the modeling of the desired architecture and configurations before actual implementation.
    - Infrastructure blueprints are created, detailing the resources, services, and networks required for the project.
2. **Implementation**
    - IaC tools are used to provision and configure the defined infrastructure based on the coded configurations.
    - Code templates are deployed to cloud platforms or on-premises environments to create the actual infrastructure.
3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
    - IaC enables consistent and repeatable testing by ensuring that the same infrastructure is deployed for each test cycle.
    - Automated testing can be performed on infrastructure code to identify configuration issues early in the development process.
4. **Deployment and Release**
    - IaC ensures that the same code is used for deploying infrastructure in different environments, leading to consistent deployments across development, testing, and production.
    - Release pipelines can be set up to automate the deployment of both application code and infrastructure code.
5. **Operations and Monitoring**
    - IaC facilitates efficient monitoring and management of infrastructure by providing a clear understanding of the configurations in use.
    - Changes to infrastructure can be tracked through version control, simplifying troubleshooting and auditing.
6. **Scaling and Maintenance**
    - IaC allows for easy scaling of infrastructure by adjusting the configuration code or parameters as needed.
    - Updates and maintenance can be performed by making changes to the code and then deploying the updated configuration.
7. **Decommissioning**
    - When infrastructure is no longer needed, IaC makes it straightforward to tear down resources by executing code that reverses the provisioning process.
    - This ensures that all resources are properly terminated and no lingering components are left behind.

Apart from this classification, SysAdmins also refer to the infrastructure lifecycle in a simple method as classified below.

### Advantages of using IaC
1. **Consistency and Repeatability**
    - IaC ensures that changes to the infrastructure are *idempotent*, *consistent*, *repeatable* and *predictable*, thus reducing errors and misconfigurations.
2. **Automation**
    - IaC automates provisioning, configuration, and management tasks, *saving time* and *reducing* the need for *manual intervention*.
3. **Version Control**
    - Infrastructure code can be stored in version control systems, allowing you to *track changes*, collaborate, and *roll back* to previous states if needed.
4. **Documentation and Self-Service**
    - Infrastructure code serves as documentation, making it easier for team members to understand configurations and setups.
    - Self-service provisioning becomes possible, enabling teams to deploy resources using *pre-defined templates*.
5. **Faster Deployment**
    - IaC accelerates deployment processes, enabling *quick scaling* and *reducing time-to-market* for applications.
6. **Scalability**
    - IaC simplifies scaling by enabling you to define and deploy resources in a consistent manner across various environments.
7. **Reduced Risk of Human Error**
    - Automation through IaC reduces the likelihood of manual configuration errors that can lead to vulnerabilities and downtime.
8. **Infrastructure as Code**
    - Applying development practices to infrastructure simplifies management and aligns infrastructure with the principles of software development.
9. **Simplified Testing and QA**
    - IaC supports *automated testing* of infrastructure code, leading to faster and more consistent quality assurance processes.
10. **Efficient Collaboration**
    - Teams can *collaborate* more *effectively* as they work with code, using version control and code review processes.
11. **Cost Efficiency**
    - IaC enables efficient resource allocation and management, helping to *optimize infrastructure costs*.
12. **Compliance and Auditing**
    - IaC provides an auditable record of changes, making it easier to *maintain compliance* with regulations and internal policies.
13. **Consistent Environments**
    - IaC ensures that development, testing, and production environments are identical, reducing environment-related issues.
14. **Immutable Infrastructure**
    - With IaC, infrastructure can be treated as *immutable*, promoting *easier updates*, *rollback*, and *security*.

::: info Idempotency
**Idempotency** is a concept in computer science and mathematics that describes an operation or function that can be *applied multiple times without changing the result* beyond the initial application. In other words, if an idempotent operation is performed once or multiple times, the *final state remains the same* as if it had been performed just once.

- In IaC, idempotent scripts or configurations ensure that the infrastructure resources are created or configured consistently, regardless of how many times the script is executed.
- When an idempotent IaC script is run:
    - If the infrastructure resources already exist and match the desired state described in the script, no changes are made.
    - If the infrastructure resources do not exist or deviate from the desired state, the script creates or configures them to match the specified state.
- This property is valuable because it allows the application of IaC scripts multiple times without causing unintended changes or disruptions to the infrastructure being worked on.
- It simplifies management by eliminating the need to track the current state of resources and ensures that the infrastructure remains in a known and consistent state.
:::

::: info Immutability
**Immutability** is a concept in computer science and software engineering that refers to the characteristic of an object, data structure, or state that cannot be modified after it is created. In other words, once an immutable object is created, its content or state remains fixed and cannot be changed. Any attempt to modify it results in the creation of a new object or instance with the desired changes, leaving the original object unchanged.

**Immutability in IaC:**
- In IaC, immutability means that once infrastructure resources are created or configured, their state remains fixed and cannot be altered directly. Any changes or updates to the infrastructure result in the creation of new resources with the desired configurations.
- Immutability is often associated with the idea of treating infrastructure as disposable. Rather than trying to modify a running server or network configuration, you discard the old resource and create a new one with the updated settings.
- Immutability aligns with the principle of predictability and reduces the risk of configuration drift or unintended changes in your infrastructure.

**Benefits:**
- **Predictability:** Immutability ensures that your infrastructure remains consistent and predictable. Each change results in a new resource with the expected configuration.
- **Reproducibility:** Infrastructure can be easily recreated from code, which is valuable for disaster recovery, scaling, and testing purposes.
- **Parallelism:** Immutable infrastructure is well-suited for parallel and automated provisioning. Multiple instances of the same resource can be created simultaneously without concerns about shared state.
- **Consistency:** Immutability helps maintain consistent environments across development, testing, and production, as configurations are fixed and well-defined.
